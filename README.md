# my-dev-skills-lab

Requirements:

Add HTML and CSS as necessary to implement an application that looks close to this wireframe:


Code the following user stories, using jQuery where possible:

As a User (AAU), I don't want to see any developer skills in the list so that I can start with a fresh slate.

AAU, I want to be able to type in a skill and have it added to my list of skills by clicking a button.

AAU, I want to be able to remove an individual skill one at a time in case I make a mistake.

Bonus:  
Replace the first user story above with the following story:
AAU, I want to see my previous list of developer skills so that I can start from where I last left off.
